This repository contains a collection of my web development projects, including a Codsoft Project Portfolio, a Landing Page, and a Calculator. These projects showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each project is designed to demonstrate key web development concepts, from building responsive layouts to implementing interactive elements. Feel free to explore the code and check out the live demos for a better understanding of my work.
